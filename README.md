# PeaversAlwaysSquare

*Because tanks need squares on their heads, not stars in their eyes.*

## What This Addon Does

Ever been in a dungeon where someone keeps changing your carefully placed raid icon?
Ever wanted to scream "THE TANK IS ALWAYS THE SQUARE" into voice chat?

Well, scream no more! PeaversAlwaysSquare automatically and relentlessly marks your group's tank with a square icon.
If someone dares to change it, PeaversAlwaysSquare will immediately change it back, with the quiet persistence of a demon hunter who's spotted a shiny new glaive.

## Features

- **Unwavering Dedication**: Automatically marks tanks with the square icon
- **Stubborn as a Dwarf**: Immediately reapplies the mark if someone changes it
- **Customizable Iconography**: Change which icon to use with a simple command (but why would you use anything but square? Are you a monster?)
- **Debugging Tools**: For when things go sideways, like a gnome on a mechanical chicken mount

## Commands

- `/tm` - Force mark all tanks right now (for the impatient)
- `/tm icon N` - Change icon ID to N (1-8), if you're one of *those* people who thinks tanks should be skulls
- `/tm test` - Test all icons on yourself (Warning: May cause mild identity crisis)
- `/tm debug` - Toggle debug mode (For when you need to see how the sausage is made)

## Icon Reference

| ID | Icon Name | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| 1  | Star      | Pretty but wrong for tanks |
| 2  | Circle    | Round like a tank's belly, but still wrong |
| 3  | Diamond   | Fancy, but tanks aren't made of carbon |
| 4  | Triangle  | A mathematical tribute to tanks, but no |
| 5  | Moon      | Only for druids and night elf cosplayers |
| 6  | Square    | THE ONE TRUE TANK MARKER |
| 7  | Cross     | For when your healer abandons you |
| 8  | Skull     | What happens when you pull without a tank |

## FAQ

**Q: Can I mark healers too?**
A: No. Healers don't deserve special treatment. They know what they did.

**Q: My tank is refusing to be marked as square. What do I do?**
A: Time to find a new tank. This one is clearly broken.

**Q: I prefer marking tanks as skulls. Can your addon do that?**
A: Yes, with `/tm icon 8`, but we'll silently judge you for it.

**Q: Does this work with Classic WoW?**
A: Like a gnome fits in plate armor. (That means no.)


## Legal

PeaversAlwaysSquare is not responsible for:
- Hurt feelings when someone's creative marking system is overridden
- Loss of friends who insist tanks should be stars
- Any existential crises caused by staring at floating squares for too long

*"Square tanks, square markers. It's not rocket engineering."*
